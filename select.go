// Each channel will receive a value after some amount of time, 
// to simulate e.g. blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines.
// Weâ€™ll use select to await both of these values simultaneously, 
// printing each one as it arrives.We receive the values "one" and then "two" as expected
// Note that the total execution time is only ~2 seconds since both the 1 and 2 second Sleeps execute concurrently.
